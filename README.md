# 👋 Hey there! I'm Robert  

🎓 Student at **Polytechnic University of Timișoara**, studying **System Engineering**  
🔧 Tinkerer by nature, breaking and fixing things (not always in that order)  
🖥️ Favorite language? **C++**—because life is too short for garbage collection  
🤖 Into **embedded systems**, because making hardware obey my code is just too satisfying  
💡 Always working on something... probably debugging it

### 🛠️ Skills & Interests:
- C++ (yes, I actually enjoy pointers)
- Embedded systems (because blinking LEDs is the first step to world domination)
- Linux (because Windows Update has personally wronged me)
- ROS2 & robotics (teaching machines to move is fun, until they chase me)

### 🚀 Random Facts:
- My projects usually start with *"This should be simple..."* and end with *"Why is this not working?"*
- "If it compiles, ship it" is a valid debugging strategy... right?
- Tinkering is just a fancy word for *"voiding warranties"*
